Plot Phonegap Coupon Example
============================

Example to enable relevant location based notifications in Phonegap.

This example only works correctly in iOS.

To get this working, you still have to add the Plot plugin. You can add the plugin to an existing project by executing the following command: phonegap local plugin add https://github.com/Plotprojects/plot-phonegap-plugin/ or cordova plugin add https://github.com/Plotprojects/plot-phonegap-plugin/ in case you are using Cordova.
